\title{SIAMCAT: Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial
Communities And host phenoTypes}
\description{
Pipeline for Statistical Inference of Associations between
Microbial Communities And host phenoTypes (SIAMCAT). A primary goal
of analyzing microbiome data is to determine changes in community
composition that are associated with environmental factors. In particular,
linking human microbiome composition to host phenotypes such as diseases
has become an area of intense research. For this, robust statistical
modeling and biomarker extraction toolkits are crucially needed. SIAMCAT
provides a full pipeline supporting data preprocessing, statistical
association testing, statistical modeling (LASSO logistic regression)
including tools for evaluation and interpretation of these models (such as
cross validation, parameter selection, ROC analysis and diagnostic
model plots).
